To run:

Download the zip file.
Inside the "Final Project" folder is the application we presented on December 6, 2021. It contains the main class. 
We recommend you use an IDE for this install, as it has a several dependencies. We used eclipse for development. 
Add all the files in the "Dependencies" folder to the buildpath of the project. 
Run the "Main.java" class. 



To use:

In order to use this, the core database must still be running or you will get an SQL connection error. 

When the application opens, first you must register for an account. All fields are required. The application doesnt use the entered phone or email. However it will check that the phone number is valid. Do not use dashes in it. 

Use the username and password used to login.
